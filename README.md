# My Full-Stack Project

This project is a full-stack web application that integrates the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: Built with **React** and **Redux** for state management, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **TypeScript**: Enhances type safety and improves code maintainability, making development more robust.
- **Backend**: Powered by **Node.js** with **Express**, offering RESTful API endpoints for seamless data operations.
- **Database**: Utilizes **MongoDB** to store and manage application data efficiently.

## Key Features
- **CRUD Functionality**: Supports create, read, update, and delete operations.
- **API Communication**: Facilitates communication between the frontend and backend for data fetching and updates.
- **State Management**: Efficiently manages application state using Redux.
